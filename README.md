# C Programming Course

This repository contains all the C programming code I worked on during my first year of BCA. It covers various programming concepts and includes two mini projects that demonstrate practical applications of these concepts.
 **Basics of C**
 **Functions**
 **Arrays and Strings**
 **Pointers**
 **Structures and Unions**
 **File Handling**
 ## Mini Projects
1. **Number Guessing Game**
    - You have to guess the number correctly and it tracks your number of guesses and it tell you either your guessed number is greater than actual number or lesser than acctual number and when you guess correctly it ends with cogratulaltions message.
    
2. **Snake Water Gun**
    -This project contains a simple implementation of the Snake Water Gun game in C. It's a console-based game where the player competes against the computer. Each player chooses one of the three options: Snake, Water, or Gun. The winner is determined based on predefined rules:
- Snake drinks Water (Snake wins)
- Water extinguishes Gun (Water wins)
- Gun shoots Snake (Gun wins)
